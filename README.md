# Flutter-project
This is a flutter project to learn how to use flutter


## Project Description
A mobile app that can tell you how busy a location is in real-time. It will try to crowd-source information
and try to give the user the most accurate information as to how busy a location like a coffee shop is for 
instance. 

We will start small with specific locations such as coffee shops, and we will try to at first gather information
only on how many seats are available for example. This should be a simpler first step that should take the app in the
right direction.

## Technology Stack And Tools
We know we will be using the Flutter sdk and the Dart programming language to write the front-end of the mobile app.
We will have to use a tool that will enable us to use location of person.
We will need a database, and a real-time infrastructure to relay data to users in real-time.

## How To Run Project
Command-Line: type 'flutter run' to run the project. You must be at the
root of the project folder since it looks for the 'pubspec.yaml' file.

## What Is It Run On
The flutter project is run on a device. It could be an emulator, or a 
real device connected via USB. The real device would have to have developer mode
enabled. There are also pleny of tutorials online on how to set-up an emulator
(you will be using an android emulator most likely)
